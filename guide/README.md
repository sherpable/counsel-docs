# Introduction

## What is Counsel?

Counsel is an elegant testing framework for JavaScript and Vue.js without using "callback testing style" like many other JavaScript testing frameworks do. It's more like [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/).

## Why Counsel?

From origin I am a php developer and realy love using [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/). I like the way PHPUnit let you create a "test" class that's sort of connected with a "source" class. Also using the methods from a test class as tests who will be executed is something I love. The test methods will give you a nice overview about the features from a "source" class. Especially when using an IDE.

There are many other JavaScript testing frameworks like: [jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/), [mocha](https://mochajs.org/), [ava](https://ava.li/) or [jest](https://jestjs.io/). All those frameworks are using a callback approach to write tests, which you may like or not. Counsel will take a different approach, it's more like PHPUnit. So let's [get started](getting-started.html).
